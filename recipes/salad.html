    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Mixed greens (e.g., spinach, arugula, or lettuce)</li>
    <li>Cherry tomatoes</li>
    <li>Cucumber</li>
    <li>Red onion</li>
    <li>Olive oil (for dressing)
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <p>To make the salad, start by washing and drying the mixed greens thoroughly. Slice the cucumber and red onion into thin rings, and halve the cherry tomatoes. In a large bowl, combine the greens, tomatoes, cucumber, and onion. For the dressing, drizzle olive oil over the salad, and add salt and pepper to taste. Toss everything gently to mix the ingredients and coat them in the dressing. If desired, you can add extra toppings like crumbled feta, nuts, or a squeeze of lemon juice for extra flavor. Serve immediately and enjoy your fresh, vibrant salad!</p>
