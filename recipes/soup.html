    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <p>To prepare the soup, start by chopping the carrots, celery, and onion into small pieces. Mince the garlic and saut√© it in a large pot with a bit of olive oil until fragrant. Add the chopped vegetables to the pot and cook for 5-7 minutes until they begin to soften. Pour in the vegetable broth, bring to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer. Let the soup simmer for 20-30 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Season with salt, pepper, and any herbs of your choice, like thyme or bay leaves. Serve hot with a slice of crusty bread!</p>
