<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Pizza dough</li>
    <li>Tomato sauce</li>
    <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>Pepperoni (or your preferred topping)</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>To prepare the pizza, preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness, then transfer it to a baking sheet or pizza stone. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust. Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce, then add your choice of toppings, such as pepperoni, vegetables, or olives. Drizzle a little olive oil around the edges of the crust for extra flavor and a golden finish. Bake the pizza for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned. Remove from the oven, slice, and enjoy!</p>
