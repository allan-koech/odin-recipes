    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Beef</li>
        <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce (or crushed tomatoes)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <p>To prepare the lasagna, first cook the ground beef in a skillet until browned, 
        then add chopped onions and garlic and cook until softened. 
        Stir in tomato sauce (or crushed tomatoes) along with herbs like basil and oregano,
         and let it simmer for 20-30 minutes to develop flavor. While the sauce simmers, cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions. In a separate bowl, mix ricotta cheese, mozzarella, and Parmesan with an egg, salt, and pepper to create the ricotta filling. Once the sauce and noodles are ready, begin assembling the lasagna by spreading a layer of sauce at the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of noodles, ricotta mixture, and more sauce. Repeat these layers until the dish is full, finishing with a top layer of sauce and mozzarella. Cover with foil and bake at 375Â°F for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 25-30 minutes until bubbly and golden.
         Let the lasagna sit for a few minutes before serving.
